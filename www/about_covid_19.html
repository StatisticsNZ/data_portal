    <p>Last updated: 23/05/2020</p>
    <h4><strong>About</strong></h4>
    <p>Stats NZ's COVID-19 data portal gathers key high-frequency and near real-time economic indicators to help track the impact of COVID-19 on the economy.</p>
    <p>It features graphs from various government agencies and private sector sources to allow users a glance at what's happening to different components of the economy in near real-time.</p>
    <p>The data will be updated as frequently as possible, in some cases on a daily or weekly basis. Other time series may have a longer time lag.</p>
    <p>The data is interactive and users can capture graph images and download selected data series in a CSV file. Time series do vary from indicator to indicator.</p>
    <p>The functionality, format and range of indicators will be developed in further iterations.</p>
    <p>Externally-sourced data has not been verified by Stats NZ. External sources of data are clearly identified, with an acknowledgement of the original source on each graph.</p>
    <p>The data is from well-established and reliable sources, for example sentiment surveys by large New Zealand banks. However, Stats NZ has not attempted to review the methodology of such surveys.</p>
    <p>Decision-makers using the data portal should refer to the original indicator source to understand how the data was collected and issues such as sample error.</p>
    <p>Data from external sources are not official statistics.</p>
    <h4><strong>Feedback</strong></h4>
