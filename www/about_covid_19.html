    <h4><strong>About</strong></h4>
    <p>Stats NZ's COVID-19 data portal gathers key economic, health, income support and social indicators to help monitor the impact of COVID-19 on New Zealand.</p>
    <p>It features graphs from various government agencies and private sector organisations to allow users to see what's happening to different components of the economy and society.</p>
    <p>Many of the indicators are high frequency and near-real time while others are less frequent yet useful in monitoring Covid-19’s impact from a wellbeing perspective. A regional lens is also available and can be easily viewed by selecting the ‘Regional Data’ filter button.</p>
    <p>Data is updated frequently, in some cases on a daily or weekly basis. Other time series may have a longer time lag. Users can capture graph images and download selected data series in a CSV file. Time series do vary from indicator to indicator.</p>
    <p>The functionality, format and range of indicators will continue to evolve and be developed in further iterations.</p>
    <p>Externally sourced data has not been verified by Stats NZ. External sources of data are clearly identified, with an acknowledgement of the original source on each graph.</p>
    <p>The data is from well-established and reliable sources. Generally, Stats NZ has not attempted to review the methodology behind the external data, apart from in some instances.</p>
    <p>Decision-makers using the data portal should refer to the original indicator source to understand how the data was collected and to consider aspects of statistical quality such as sampling error, or sample size.</p>
    <p>Data from external sources are not official statistics.</p>
