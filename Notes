API Notes:

When removing indicator fomr data defintions the visualization for that indicator will still work in the app becuase it is not being pulled from the API.
Question: Do we want to remove indicator from DATA_STORE once visualised by API?

All configuration updates should be done in config/covid_19_odata and config/covid_19_data. How should we control when these two configs become out of sync? Developers will have to remember to update the indicator names of both.

Question: How to handel when the API is using a different name than the source? config/covid_19_odata contains a name to be kept track in the portal and a seprate name that can be the same or different from teh API.
