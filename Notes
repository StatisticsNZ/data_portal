API Notes:

When removing indicator fomr data defintions the visualization for that indicator will still wirk in the app becuase it is not being pulled from the API.
Question: Do we want to remove indicator from DATA_STORE once visualised by API? If so how?

All configuration updaed should be done in config/covid_19, otherwise the latest changes from the master branch will not be merged in properly.
The configs in config/covi19_odata_api will ony be used when testing a few indicators at a time. This folder should eventually be deleted.

Question: How to handel when the API is using a different name than the source? Could change in configuration?
